        <p>I graduated from Baylor University, in May 2015 with a BFA in Studio Art, and a concentration in Graphic Design. In college I worked with Baylor Student Activities as a Graphic Designer and with the Alumni Network as a Graphic Specialist. Since school, I have held two jobs as a graphic designer and have completed multiple freelance projects. I have other work experience outside the design field as well.
